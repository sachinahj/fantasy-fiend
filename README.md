# Fantasy Fiend

A Rails-based app meant to help Fantasy Footballers during their live fantasy football draft. The information come was scraped/imported from FantasyPros.com and FantasyData.com, compiled into a database, and then a frontend was built on top of it using JavaScript (Underscore.js, Select2, DataTables, and HighCharts) and HTML5/CSS3 (Twitter Bootstrap).
